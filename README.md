# Bank Network Simulation - Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview

This project involves the simulation of a network for a banking system using Cisco Packet Tracer. The objective was to design a robust and efficient network that connects a main branch with three sub-branches, incorporating various networking technologies and protocols.

## Key Features

- **Static Routing:** Configured static routes to facilitate communication between different branches.
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Implemented RIP for dynamic routing and efficient information exchange.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Utilized DHCP to automate IP address assignments within the network.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Implemented inter-VLAN routing to segregate and manage network traffic effectively.
- **Wireless Networking:** Established wireless networks to provide seamless connectivity within the banking environment.
